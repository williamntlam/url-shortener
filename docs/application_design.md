# System Design ‚Äì Build vs Use for a URL Shortener

Great question ‚Äî and you're clearly thinking at a system design level now.

The short answer is:

> ‚úÖ **Use libraries and tools for low-level components** (like hashing, caching, and base64 encoding), but **build the core system architecture yourself** ‚Äî especially if this is a learning project or for interview prep.

## üß† Here's how to decide what to build vs. what to use:

---

### ‚úÖ You SHOULD use libraries for:

| Component                   | Recommended Tools                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hashing**                | `hashlib` in Python, `crypto` in Node.js, etc.                    |
| **Base64/Base62 encoding** | Built-in `base64` module or 3rd-party libraries                   |
| **UUID/Random key generation** | `uuid`, `secrets`, or `nanoid` (for base62 IDs)             |
| **Caching**                | Use **Redis** + client libraries like `redis-py` or `ioredis`     |
| **Database access**        | Use ORMs or DB drivers like `SQLAlchemy`, `Mongoose`, `pg-promise`|
| **Load balancing**         | Use NGINX, HAProxy, or cloud load balancers (e.g., AWS ELB)       |
| **Consistent hashing**     | Libraries like `hashring`, `jump-consistent-hash`, etc.           |

> These libraries are well-tested and optimized, so **reinventing them is unnecessary and error-prone**.

---

### üß± You SHOULD implement yourself:

| Component                                 | Why Build It                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **KGS (Key Generation Service)**         | Core to your system. Experiment with caching, concurrency, fault tolerance. |
| **Request handling logic**               | Implement the actual endpoints (`/shorten`, `/resolve`, etc.)               |
| **Database schema design**               | Lets you explore partitioning, replication, SQL vs NoSQL                    |
| **Caching strategy (LRU policy)**        | Build a simple LRU or configure Redis LRU                                   |
| **Expiration/Cleanup logic**            | Learn background jobs, TTLs, scheduling                                     |
| **Custom alias & conflict resolution**   | Ensure uniqueness and flexibility                                           |

> These are **great places to apply your own logic and learn system design**.

## üí° Best Practice: Hybrid Approach

> üöÄ Use **libraries as building blocks**, but **design the system‚Äôs logic, flow, and architecture yourself**.

This gives you:
- Speed & efficiency  
- Real-world tools experience  
- Deep understanding of trade-offs

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools You Might Use

| Feature        | Tech Stack                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **App Server** | FastAPI                                            |
| **Cache**      | Redis                                              |
| **Key Storage**| PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, or MongoDB                   |
| **Key Generator** | Use `secrets`, `uuid`, or Snowflake-style ID    |
| **Load Balancing** | NGINX locally, or AWS/GCP load balancers       |
| **Analytics**   | Kafka or log files; batch analysis later          |
